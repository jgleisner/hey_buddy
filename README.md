# hey_buddy
This is a simple module for Drupal 9 which will add a welcome block for logged in users to the sidebar in the bartik theme. 

This module creates and installs a sidebar block with a few settings already enabled: A welcome message to be displayed to all users of the site, and a toggle checkbox to disable the welcome message for Anonymous users.
